##  4. <a name='Courseteam'></a>Course team

This course will be mainly taught by [Prof. Lydia Y Chen](https://lydiaychen.github.io/). The course team is composed of a number of PhDs who support the course through guest lectures and project supervision and a TA who focuses on the grading of homework.

##  5. <a name='Learningobjectives'></a>Learning objectives

- Understand and derive the expectations and variances of discrete and continuous variables
- Understand and implement the random number generators
- Design and implement an event driven simulation
- Collect and analyze the relevant performance metrics
- Applying simulation to design a better queueing systems

### Mandatory labs
There are 6 mandatory labs run by Abel Malan. They are important building blocks for your course project. The labs will not be graded.

### Project
The project is about building a queueing simulator to predict and analyze the key performance metrics, e.g., the average waiting time and the average response times.

The detailed description of the project will be published after week 4 here and the due date of the project is December 19. Students need to submit a report and do a presentation as well.

This accounts for 80 % of the final grade.

### Quizs 
There will be two in-class quizzs, 30 minutes long. Each of this will account for 15 % of your final grade.

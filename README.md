# Simulation25Fall

This is the course repoisitory for the simulation course at Data Science Bachelor Program of University of Neuchatel.
The course is worth 3 ECTS.

-  [Abele Malan](mailto:abele.malan@unine.ch)

Lydia is the responsible instructors of this course and can jointly be reached at **lydiaychen@ieee.org**.

##  5. <a name='Learningobjectives'></a>Learning objectives

- Understand and derive the expectations and variances of discrete and continuous variables
- Understand and implement the random number generators
- Design and implement an event driven simulation
- Collect and analyze the relevant performance metrics
- Applying simulation to design a better queueing systems

### Mandatory labs
There are 6 mandatory labs run by the TAs.
They are important building blocks for your quizzes and course project.
The labs will not be graded, but the quizzes and project are.

### Project
The project is about building a queueing simulator to predict and analyze the key performance metrics, e.g., the average waiting time and the average response times.

The detailed description of the project will be published after week 4 here and the due date of the project is December 19.
Students need to submit a report and do a presentation as well.
This accounts for 80 % of the final grade.

### Quizzes
There will be two in-class quizzes, 30 minutes long.
Each will account for 15 % of your final grade.
